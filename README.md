# Anku Projects 2021
This repository contains various projects developed by Anku in 2021. The projects cover topics such as parsing tables, vending machine simulations, and data implementations.

# Project Descriptions
- Parsing Table Code
The parsing table code project focuses on implementing a parsing table for a specific grammar. It involves generating a table that represents the production rules and non-terminals of the grammar. This parsing table can be used to parse input strings and determine their validity according to the specified grammar.

- Vending Machine Code
The vending machine code project simulates the behavior of a vending machine. It involves designing the logic for item selection, payment processing, and item dispensing. The code provides an interactive interface for users to select items, input payment, and receive their selected items.

- Data Implementation Code
The data implementation code project covers various data structures and algorithms. It includes implementations of common data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees, as well as algorithms such as sorting and searching. These implementations serve as a foundation for understanding and utilizing data structures and algorithms in different applications.

# File Structure
